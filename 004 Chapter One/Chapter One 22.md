“Instead of admitting the truth about how they feel, they react to their feelings and fail to think. 

They feel the fear so they go to work, hoping that money will **soothe** the fear, but it doesn’t.

 It continues to **haunt** them and they return to work, hoping again that money will calm their fears, and again it doesn’t. 

Fear keeps them in this trap of working, earning money, working, earning money, hoping the fear will go away. 

But every day they get up, and that old fear wakes up with them. For millions of people that old fear keeps them awake all night, causing a night of **turmoil** and worry. So they get up and go to work, hoping that a paycheck will kill that fear **gnawing** at their soul. 

Money is running their lives, and they refuse to tell the truth about that. Money is in control of their emotions and their souls.”

“ desire. Some call it greed, but I prefer desire. It’s **perfectly** normal to desire something better, prettier, more fun, or exciting. 

So people also work for money because of desire.

 They desire money for the joy they think it can buy. But **the joy that money brings is often short-lived**, and they soon need more money for more joy, more pleasure, more **comfort**, and more security. 

So they keep working, thinking money will soothe their souls that are troubled by fear and desire. 

But money can’t do that.”

“In fact, the reason many rich people are rich isn’t because of desire, but because of fear. 

They believe that money can **eliminate** the fear of being poor, so they **amass** **tons of** it, only to find the fear gets worse. 

Now they fear losing the money. I have friends who keep working even though they have **plenty**. I know people who have millions who are more afraid now than when they were poor. They’re terrified of losing it all. 

The fears that drove them to get rich got worse. That weak and needy part of their soul is actually screaming louder. They don’t want to lose the big houses, the cars and the high life money has bought them. 

They worry about what their friends would say if they lost all their money.

 Many are emotionally **desperate** and **neurotic**, although they look rich and have more money.”
