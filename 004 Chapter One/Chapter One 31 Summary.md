over around a totally month, chapter one and introduction of Rich dad Poor dad has been readed. lots of ideas from the book has been extremely influenced me. especially the mind that the rich do not work for money, and they make money work for them .

Sounds great. But there is a doubt that how and where to get money when start business . You could not gain money with empty in your hand.

The common principles that everyone can understand. but the mindset and action is hardly to change.
